In 1997, a casual research meeting between researchers at the <a href="http://amath.colorado.edu">University of Colorado's Applied Math Department</a>
and <a href="http://www.llnl.gov/CASC/">Lawrence Livermore National Lab's CASC Division</a> met in Frisco, Colorado, to collaborate on AMG and related issues. They met again in Boulder in 1998. In 2000, the meetings became annual. The Summits from 2000 to 2009 were held in Lake City, Colorado. From 2002 until 2006, they expanded to include an Applied Math research retreat, primarily focused on the FOSLS methodology. Between 2010 and 2015, the Summits alternated between Boulder in even years and Lake City in odd years. In 2016, the Summits began alternating between Los Osos, on California&#39;s central coast, in even years and Lake City, in southwestern Colorado&#39;s high country, in odd years.<br><br>

The structure is like that of the
<!-- a href="http://amath.colorado.edu/faculty/copper/" -->
<a href="http://grandmaster.colorado.edu/~copper/index.html">
Copper Mountain meetings</a> in the sense of morning and
evening sessions, with afternoons free to recover from the intensity of the discussions. But the 'sessions' are much different. We strongly
discourage formal talks about what is known in favor of exposing troubles and open issues. The knowledge content is primarily for setting the scene
for the attendees to try to work on troubles and questions, and help suggest some avenues of further research. <br><br><br>

<br><br>

The following lists represent the main topics of discussion at the recent Summits. <br>

<li>Parallel time integration for hyperbolic problems
<li>AMR for FOSLS
<li>Ill-conditioning effects on MG & AMG
<li>AMG for boundary conditions treated by Nitsche's method
<li>AMG for FOSLS applied to hyperbolic equations
<li>Necessary and sufficient conditions for two-level convergence of MGRiT
<li>Optimal coarse-grid solvers for MGRiT
<li>Space-time for hyperbolic PDEs
<li>Unassembled AIR for advection
<li>Coarsening for pAIR
<li>MG for uncertainty quantification, particularly for Bayesian inference
<li>MG reduction for reservoir modeling

<li>Coarse-grid stability and convergence for hypersonic flow
<li>AMGe
<li>MG for fractional Laplacians
<li>Implementation for elasticity
<li>Stopping criteria for iterative solvers
<li>MG for structured/unstructured matrices

<h3>The 2017 meeting</h3>

<li>With half precision (16 bit!) hardware coming out, can we use this with multigrid, e.g. when representing the values in a hierarchical way? 
<li>The best published algorithm for 2D multigrid is St&uuml;ben&apos;s 1982 version using 30 Flops per unknown. Can one do better? What are the optimal algorithms for 3D? What for other problems? Higher order? Stokes?
<li>When data transport is the dominating cost factor, can we prove lower bounds for MG? How would we quantify data transport in MG anyway? 
<li>Will we ever be able to state beforehand what the <i>total</i> cost 
will be to solve any particular but practical class of nxn matrix equations by AMG?
<li>Adaptive and bootstrap AMG and SA attempt to determine local representations for the near-kernel components of relaxation automatically by solving Ax=0. But how can we determine the <i>minimal</i> number of local vectors we need to do this (i. e., a local &apos;basis&apos;)? Classical  adaptive SA readily determines when we don&apos;t have enough (i. e., when the vectors don&apos;t &apos;span&apos; the near kernel), but how do we best handle redundancy (i. e., &apos;linear dependence&apos;)?
<li>What is the status of AMG for Helmholtz, systems, and nonsymmetric problems?
<li>Can MGRIT be used for neural networks?
<li>We generally expect PDE solutions to be smooth in the limit of refinement so that at two sufficiently close points the solution will be almost identical. Given that one will only differ from the other by a few bits, can we do something smarter than storing both numbers in full precision? Can we operate directly on some kind of compressed representation, or just on the differences?
<li>What&apos;s the status of wavelet multigrid research?
<li>What&apos;s the status of multigrid methods for training algorithms of deep neural networks? 
<li>What is the correct balance between restriction and interpolation for non-symmetric problems?
Symmetric theory says interpolation must approximate low modes accurately. For non-symmetric
systems, if we use ideal interpolation, restriction is not too important. Conversely, if we use ideal 
restriction, interpolation is not very important.
<li>Multigrid based on approximate ideal reduction has been developed and works well on
logically lower triangular systems.  Can multigrid beat a backsolve for lower triangular systems 
on a parallel machine?
<li>Two-grid and V-cycle theory is well developed for SPD systems, especially M-matrices.
What is the best way to generalize this to non symmetric systems?
<li>Parallel in time (PiT) algorithms have been developed and shown to be more effective than
sequential time stepping on massively parallel machines. Recently,  PiT  algorithms were modified 
to include Richardson extrapolation and adaptive time stepping. Can they be modified to
give both spatial and temporal local adaptive refinement?
<li>How do we precondition block-structured matrices, especially those from discretized first-order systems and, in particular, by way of a Schur complement?
